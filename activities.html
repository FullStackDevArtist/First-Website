	<h1>Human-Centered Immersive Technology</h1>
        <p>Immersive technology is redefining how we solve problems, share stories, and interact with the world. From healthcare to manufacturing, education to entertainment, its impact spans industries, offering new ways to visualize data, enhance collaboration, and create more engaging experiences.</p>
        <p>However, as these technologies become more integrated into daily life, we must take a humanity-first approach to their design and implementation. The way we build and use immersive technology has the power to bring people closer together or drive them apart. It can make communication more meaningful or more toxic.</p>
        <p>Ethical design, inclusivity, and thoughtful user experiences must be at the core of development, ensuring these innovations empower individuals, enhance storytelling, and drive positive change. By putting people first, we can shape a future where immersive technology not only enhances efficiency and creativity but also strengthens human connection in a responsible and impactful way.</p>
